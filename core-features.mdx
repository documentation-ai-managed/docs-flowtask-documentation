### Workspaces

A workspace is a complete environment for your project. Unlike traditional folders, workspaces contain living, interconnected elements that evolve with your work.

**What's in a workspace:**

- Structured task hierarchies

- Contextual documentation

- Custom forms and data collection

- Organized collaboration areas

**Creating workspaces**

Navigate to your dashboard and click "Create New Workspace." Describe your project in 1-2 sentences, including suggested details such as:

- Your goal or objective

- Key deliverables

- Team size or roles

- Timeline or constraints

After entering your prompt, FlowTask will generate a comprehensive workspace. Review the structure and make any adjustments before sharing with your team.

### Prompt-Driven Creation

FlowTask's intelligence comes from understanding intent. You don't need to know the "right way" to structure work—just describe what you're trying to accomplish.

**Good prompts include:**

- Clear objectives

- Relevant context

- Key constraints

- Expected outcomes

The AI handles translation from idea to structure.

**Example prompts:**

- "Quarterly planning for a team of 12 with focus on product development"

- "Customer onboarding workflow with automated emails and feedback loops"

- "Event planning for 200-person conference including vendor coordination"

### Adaptive Structure

Generated workspaces aren't rigid. As your project evolves, you can:

- Regenerate specific sections

- Add new areas

- Restructure entirely

- Combine workspaces

The AI learns from your changes and improves future suggestions.
