### Create your first workspace

Creating a workspace in FlowTask takes seconds. Simply describe what you're working on, and FlowTask generates everything you need.

**Your first workspace**

The first step to using FlowTask is creating a workspace. Click the "Create New Workspace" button at the top of your dashboard to get started.

You have two options:

- Start with a prompt

- Import from template

**Describe your project**

When creating a workspace, you will be prompted to describe what you're working on. This can be as specific or as broad as you'd like.

For example:

- "Launch a product beta with 50 users"

- "Plan our Q1 marketing campaign"

- "Onboard a new engineering hire"

The more context you provide, the better your workspace will be. Include details like team size, timeline, and desired outcomes.

**Review your workspace**

FlowTask will instantly generate a complete workspace with:

- Task hierarchies broken down into actionable steps

- Draft documentation for key areas

- Pre-configured forms and templates

- Organized collaboration spaces

You can start working immediately, or refine and customize the structure to fit your needs.
