### Introduction

FlowTask uses C1-level structured AI to transform your ideas into organized workspaces. Unlike other tools that help you manage work, FlowTask creates the structure itself.

**How it works:**

FlowTask follows a simple two-step method.

**Step 1:** Describe your project in natural language.

**Step 2:** Review and refine the generated workspace.

### The Method in Action

For example, say you need to create a workspace for:

Product launch in 6 weeks

Coordinate design, engineering, and marketing teams

Include beta testing phase with 50 users

Set up feedback collection process

Create launch day checklist

### Step 1: Describe Your Project

Simply enter your project description in the workspace creation prompt:

*"We're launching a new feature in 6 weeks. Need to coordinate design, engineering, and marketing. Include a beta testing phase with 50 users and a feedback collection process."*

FlowTask analyzes your prompt and understands:

- Timeline (6 weeks)

- Teams involved (design, engineering, marketing)

- Key phases (development, beta testing, launch)

- Deliverables (feature, feedback system, launch checklist)

### Step 2: Review Your Workspace

FlowTask generates a complete workspace structure, including:

**Tasks & Subtasks**

- Week 1-2: Design & Planning

- Week 3-4: Development & QA

- Week 5: Beta Testing

- Week 6: Launch Preparation

**Documentation**

- Feature specification

- Beta testing guide

- Launch checklist

- Team responsibilities

**Forms & Templates**

- Beta user signup

- Feedback collection

- Bug reports

- Launch day schedule

### Iterating on Your Workspace

You can continue to refine your workspace after generation. Either regenerate specific sections or manually adjust the structure.

💡

Reminder: FlowTask generates the starting structure. You maintain full control to customize, reorganize, or regenerate any part of your workspace
